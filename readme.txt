i am mult program - clojure(script) extension for vscode

- my language is clojure
- my runtime is jvm
- i consist of processes and queues - i do asynchrony with core.async library
- i am config driven: i have no connection sequences, jack-ins, jack-ass - user defines repls in mult.edn file, i lazy-connect when needed
- a namespace and repls: my tab is clear, shows current namespace and repls user can evalutate in
- my tabs are like browser pages: it's one tab app, but user can open multiple, just like in the browser
- i am simple: indent-only code formatting, colors
- i say no to code linting, static analysis and other crotches: shouldn't be part of programming - writing code it's a creative process
- i say no to store and no to binaries released with my repository: my repository is only source code and i am built from source
- releases - i say no, commit hashses define me
- updates - i say no to updates and update notifications
- compile - i compile one cli command, i use jpackage program, i require clj, jvm programs
- logo - i have no logo, my name, a word - mult - defines me
